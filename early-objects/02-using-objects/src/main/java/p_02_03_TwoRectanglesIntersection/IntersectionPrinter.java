/**
 * The {@code intersection} method computes the <em>intersection</em> of two
 * rectangles â€” that is, the rectangle that would be formed by two overlapping
 * rectangles if they were drawn, as shown at right.
 * <p>
 * You call this method as follows:
 * <p><pre>
 *      {@code Rectangle r3 = r1.intersection(r2);}
 * <p><pre>
 * Write a program {@code IntersectionPrinter} that constructs two rectangle
 * objects, prints them as described in Exercise P2.1, and then prints the
 * rectangle object that describes the intersection. Then the program should
 * print the result of the {@code intersection} method when the rectangles do
 * not overlap. Add a comment to your program that explains how you can tell
 * whether the resulting rectangle is empty.
