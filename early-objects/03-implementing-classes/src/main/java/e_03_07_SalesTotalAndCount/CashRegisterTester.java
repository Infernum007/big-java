 * After closing time, the store manager would like to know how much business

 * enable this functionality. Supply methods {@code getSalesTotal} and
 * {@code getSalesCount} to get the total amount of all sales and the number of
 * sales. Supply a method {@code reset} that resets any counters and totals so
 * that the next dayâ€™s sales start from zero.
